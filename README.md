📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Airbnb customer survey data to understand user satisfaction, experience, and overall service quality. Using NumPy for data processing and Tableau for building an interactive dashboard, the project evaluates customer feedback and measures the Net Promoter Score (NPS) to determine how likely customers are to recommend Airbnb.
The goal is to identify promoters, passives, and detractors, and uncover trends that influence customer experience.
